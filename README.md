## INTRO
This directory contains the source code of PhysicoChemical FCGR (PC-FCGR) pipeline -a tool for an automatic bacteria taxonomic classification of metagenomics data, which employs 8 well known machine learning classifiers. The source code may be used for non-commercial research provided you acknowledge the source by citing the following paper:</p>
## PREREQUISITES
The method was implemented in Python 3.8 with the use of scikit-learn library running on a normal desktop computer (CPU: i7-6500 2.5 GHz, RAM: 8 GB RAM, HD: 256GB Lexar, GPU: GeForce GTX 920M.
